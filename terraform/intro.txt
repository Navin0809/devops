Iac
infrastructure as code

every csp has their own tools

we need genric approach to infra as code
as every cloud provider as their own tools 

Terraform is the generic approach for Iac
Api as code

Terraform plan:
terraform supports dry run
dry run: test run 

install terraform :

basic commands:

terraform init -initialize
terraform plan -dry run
terraform apply -created real infrastructure
terraform destroy

navigate to the file path local_state and type terraform init
main.tf (file name)

terrraform authenticates only if its preconfigured aws cli

output.tf
output data 

input.tf

vairable.tf
store the variables

terraform.tfstate
tracks all the infra created previously 

we cannot store state file in git or local machine
as it contains all sensitive info
and multiple user/s merges issue

we must store in remote backend
ex-s3 

use dynamo db ,which locks the state file ,which results in no conflicts

remote backend:

remote_state

terraform modules:
whenever there is a reusable code
they can reference this modules,pre written 


problems:
state file is a single point of failure

manual changes cannot be identified,not auto corrected

not a gitops friendly tool,nor with flux or argo cd
